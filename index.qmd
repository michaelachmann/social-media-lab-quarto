title: "Notes on Computational Social Media Research"

![](images/banner2.png)

Welcome to this collection of notes on social media analysis with a special focus on computational methods. It is a work-in-progress website, created as part of my PhD project and teaching at the Media Informatics Group at the University of Regensburg, Germany. My name is [Michael Achmann-Denkler](https://go.ur.de/michael-achmann) and Iâ€™m currently experimenting with computational approaches for multimodal analysis of social media content, like Instagram posts and stories. My aim for this website is to develop a collection of notes exploring various methodologies, techniques, and tools for social media research. As a first milestone, the website will accompany my research seminar [Computational Analysis of Visual Social Media](https://campusportal.uni-regensburg.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&_flowExecutionKey=e1s1) in the 2023/24 winter semester.
