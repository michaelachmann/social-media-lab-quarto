![](images/banner2.png)

Welcome to this collection of notes on social media analysis with a special focus on computational methods. It is a work-in-progress website, created as part of my PhD project and teaching at the Media Informatics Group at the University of Regensburg, Germany. My name is [Michael Achmann-Denkler](https://go.ur.de/michael-achmann) and Iâ€™m currently experimenting with computational approaches for multimodal analysis of social media content, like Instagram posts and stories. My aim for this website is to develop a collection of notes exploring various methodologies, techniques, and tools for social media research. As a first milestone, the website will accompany my research seminar [Computational Analysis of Visual Social Media](https://campusportal.uni-regensburg.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&_flowExecutionKey=e1s1) in the 2023/24 winter semester.

## Content

* [Course Organization](getting-started/index.qmd): Introduction to the course including the course schedule.
* [Introduction to Social Media Analysis](getting-started/theory.qmd):  Overview of Social Media Analysis (SMA) in academic and professional contexts, focusing on its intersection with communication science, political science, and computational methods. 
* [Tools](getting-started/tools.qmd): A short guide for tools and software beneficial for visual social media analysis. Key tools discussed include Colab, a Google platform for collaborative work using Python and Jupyter notebooks, and Obsidian, a versatile note-taking app with plugins for task organization and literature notes.
* [Data Collection: Instagram Posts](data-collection/ig-posts.qmd): Code examples and notebooks to collect Instagram posts using instaloader, CrowdTangle, or Zeeschuimer & 4CAT.
* [Data Collection: Instagram Stories](data-collection/ig-stories.qmd):  Code examples and notebooks to collect Instagram posts using instaloader or Zeeschuimer-F. 
* [Data Collection: TikTok (External)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MAiqX7Vx1FcNJ44K-vSdnKDVC5gcFwtrSQiewnwW8A/edit?pli=1): Link to the Zeeschuimer & 4CAT manual for TikTok provided by the [digital methods initiative](https://digitalmethods.net/).
* [Text as Data](processing/index.qmd): Provides an overview of using text as a data source in computational social science. It differentiates between structured and unstructured data, emphasizing the complexity of processing unstructured language data.
* [Text Exploration](processing/exploration.qmd): Introduces two approaches for the exploration of textual content: Topic Modeling using BERTopic and OpenAI's GPT-API.
* [Text Classification](processing/classification.qmd): An introduction to text classification using GPT. The article presents several approaches, like Zero-Shot and Few-Shot classification. The accompanying notebook provides all the necessary code to get started with GPT.
* [Gold Standard Validation](evaluation/index.qmd): This chapter emphasizes the importance of validation in computational social media analysis, focusing on external validation through non-expert annotations using LabelStudio for creating gold standard data. It discusses developing an annotation manual and setting up a Label Studio project for text data annotation, highlighting the iterative nature of manual development and the importance of clear, consistent guidelines. 
* [Agreement & Evaluation](evaluation/agreement.qmd): *Work in Progress*.
* Exploration of Visual Data: *Work in Progress*.
* Computational Image Classification: *Work in Progress*.
* Optimizing Image Classification: *Work in Progress*.
* Data Analysis as a Conversation -- Exploring trends using ChatGPT: *Work in Progress*.
* Visual Presentation of your Data & Results: RAWGraphs and more: *Work in Progress*.
