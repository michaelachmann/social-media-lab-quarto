    "text": "The research seminar Computational Analysis of Visual Social Media consists of project-centred work in groups, lectures on theory and practical sessions. Each group will follow their own research interests and datasets. Groups will be formed in the third session, together with preliminary topics. We have participants from different fields, the topics will mirror this interdisciplinarity, roughly drawn from the interesctions of media studies, political science, and communication science. The seminar aims at master students with first knowledge of at least one programming language.\n\n\nBy the end of the semester you should know more about:\n\nThe state of Social Media Research,\ninteresting questions to answer with social media data,\nethical and legal restrictions,\ndevelop operationalizations for visual and textual data,\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the semester you will be able to:\n\nCollect Instagram stories, posts and TikTok videos,\napply OCR and automatically transcribe videos,\ncomputationally classify text and images using GPT and CLIP,\nevaluate and optimize your classifications using human annotations,\npresent your results.\n\n\n\n\nThe following expectations and criteria must be met to pass the course:\n\nIndependent familiarization with your own scientific topic: Literature research, formulation of research questions, and operationalization.\nWillingness to master new tools (supported by practical units and some provided Jupyter Notebooks).\nActive and regular team collaboration on the individual project.\nContinuous documentation of current progress through a project wiki.\nWriting a project report at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will openly document our project progress, incorporating a strong Open Science stance.\nThe project report template is a good starting point for your report and continuous documentation.\nThrough the semester we will come back to the draft and extend it towards the final report.\nThe goal is to publish the report on social-media-lab.net.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project report will be handed in collaboratively,\nconsists of app. 20 pages,\nfollows the IMRAD1 principle,\nuses APA citation style,\nneeds to be handed in no later than 31.03.2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggest your own project\nPossible Projects:\n\nLandtagswahl BY 2023\n\nIG Stories & Posts\nTikTok\nJugendorganisationen\n\nPolitische Influencer auf TikTok\nWar in Sozialen Medien:\n\nUkraine Invasion\nHamas Angriff auf Israel\n\nFalschinformationen & KI-Generierte Inhalte\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost course material will be available on social-media-lab.net.\nAdditional material will be provided via GRIPS.\nWe will work collaboratively on the website through the semester.\nThe content is edited using Quarto and Markdown, you will need a GitHub Account.\nPlease provide your GitHub username to get access to the repository.\nAll content will be published under GPL-3."

    "text": "Welcome to this collection of notes on social media analysis with a special focus on computational methods. It is a work-in-progress website, created as part of my PhD project and teaching at the Media Informatics Group at the University of Regensburg, Germany. My name is Michael Achmann-Denkler and I’m currently experimenting with computational approaches for multimodal analysis of social media content, like Instagram posts and stories. My aim for this website is to develop a collection of notes exploring various methodologies, techniques, and tools for social media research. As a first milestone, the website will accompany my research seminar Computational Analysis of Visual Social Media in the 2023/24 winter semester.\nCode and notebooks will be published on GitHub, the repository is registered with zenodo, the README.md file provides detailed instructions for citing the provided code in academic work."

    "text": "While the two visual platforms Instagram and TikTok, are relatively new, plenty of research has already been published about both platforms. A naive search on google scholar for the term instagram analysis results in 4.180.000 results, for tiktok analysis in 54.800 results. We are going to take a look at current literature review studies, concentrating on Instagram. The goal for this chapter is to identify major research areas in (visual) social media research. Beyond themes, trends, and topics, review studies also offer methodological overviews on how to study social media platforms.\nAdditionally, we will explore tools like Publish or Perish that help in creating one’s own literature review. The Related Work section forms a pivotal foundation for high-quality scientific research, and a successful project report."

    "text": "Literature Reviews\nRejeb et al. (2022) compiled a bibliometric analysis of 2,242 publications collected from the Web of Science1 database. They cover publications dated from 2013–2021 and outline 22 prior review studies, most of them concentrating on a smaller scope. Topics of these reviews include: Health, Psychology, Journalism, Mental Health, Body Image, and Marketing. Overall, their bibliographic study found similar themes in the current research: Some articles analyse the use of Instagram in the context of business, marketing, and travel. Others take a psychological angle and look into personality traits or health issues. They also found scholarly articles on privacy concerns and Instagram. Here’s some research interests they encountered in their review:\n\n\nHow does Instagram affect social and health issues, such as social comparison, eating disorders, addiction, and suicidal ideation?\nHow does Instagram facilitate and transform healthcare?\nWhat are the security and privacy concerns that result from the use of Instagram?\nHow does Instagram inter-relate with other social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter?\nWhat are the emerging research trends and frontiers in Instagram research?\n\n\nThe found researchers to use a multitude of methods, including surveys and questionnaires; content analysis to examine user-generated content; experimental designs to test the effects of Instagram use on users’ psychological states and behaviors; and qualitative methods, such as interviews and focus groups, to gain in-depth insights into users’ experiences with Instagram.\nInterestingly the bibiometric study seems to overlook a larger portion of research covering political communication on Instagram. Bast (2021) concentrates on this exact topic, she reviewed 37 studies on Instagram usage by politicians, parties, and governments. 30 studies were concerned with the Instagram use of political actors. They explored different aspects, like the self-presentation of politicians, mobilization and campaign information or whether they used Instagram to talk about political issues or interact with voters. Some of the studies use a comparative approach, e.g. comparing the Instagram activity of multiple actors, others compared the Instagram usage of political actors across different countries, political systems, or election/non-election periods (Bast 2021).\nFrom a methodological point of view the reivew of visual content analysis for image-based social media by Milanesi and Guercini (2020) is quite interesting: They included 29 articles in their study and explored the platforms, that have been invastigated as well as the approach, whether the analysis was manual or automated. Outstanding at first is the large share of projects that have been classified as using automated approaches. Upon closer inspection, they have also classified the use of qualitative data analysis software like NVivo, as automation. Few projects, however, have already been using deep learning and computer vision based approaches for image analysis. Finally, the paper suggests that a mixed methodology that combines a netnographic approach, a research methodology that adapts ethnographic research techniques to the study of online communities, for textual and visual data collection in online communities and textual and visual content analysis may provide new insights for branding or destination management research. Overall, they argue for a combined analysis of textual and visual data.\nOverall, the"

    "text": "Related Work (Overview)\nOne of the first analyses of Instagram content was published in 2013: The article explores how the interfaces of social media platforms like Instagram shape user interactions and the creation and sharing of media. Through computational analysis and visualizations of Instagram content, the authors study social and cultural patterns. They compare visual data from 13 global cities and provide a detailed analysis of photos from Tel Aviv, Israel, showing how such visualizations can offer insights into social, cultural, and political activities in specific locales over time​ (Hochman and Manovich 2013). Interestingly Lev Manovich is among the authors of this paper.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the phototrails website visualizing 50.000 images per city.\n\n\nShortly afterwards, in 2014, one of the most cited studies about Instagram was published. It provides a comprehensive analysis of Instagram photo content and user types, using computer vision techniques and clustering. The authors collected Instagram data using the Instagram API and developed a coding scheme for categorizing the photos. They identified eight popular photo categories and five distinct types of Instagram users in terms of their posted photos. They also found that a user’s audience (number of followers) is independent of their shared photos on Instagram. This study was the first in-depth analysis of content and users on Instagram (Hu, Manikonda, and Kambhampati 2014).\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\nTitle\nNote\n\n\n\n\nBainotti, Caliandro, and Gandini (2020)\nFrom archive cultures to ephemeral content, and back: Studying Instagram Stories with digital methods\nThis paper explores Instagram stories and their collection.

    "text": "Writing the Related Work section\nThe aim of our project paper diverges somewhat from a comprehensive literature review, such as those that commonly serve as the start for dissertations. Nevertheless, the “Related Work” section of your paper is as an important element of your research project. The goal here is to showcase a thorough understanding of the existing literature in your field of study. This enables you to position your research within the broader academic context, highlighting its relevance and identifying gaps that your project seeks to address. It is important to discuss your findings in this section, offering insights into the methodologies, findings, and limitations of the studies you review. Here are some steps to follow:\n\nAsk yourself: What is your research interest?\n\nWrite down key-words for your research interest.\nUsing the key-words, start your initial search with e.g. the Quick and Dirty strategy. Using the first results, start an in-depth search based on other strategies.\nWrite notes to retain search terms and selected results. Tools like Obsidian or Notion are excelent tools for notes, Excel or Google Sheets are simple, yet efficient, tools to structure your searches and selected literature (and we can export the data as csv files to process them using Python). Publish or Perish is a great tool to help in this stage, as it retains a protocol of your searches and offers the data export of search results.\nConcentrate on reading the abstract in your initial searches. We have to work efficiently, the abstract should contain the most relevant information about a given article for a first evaluation of its importance for your project. In the section GPT-Assisted Review I provide a notebook with a rudimentary interface for the first decision-making.\nUse literature management software like Paperpile, Zotero, or Citavi to organize your reading. You might start using the software already at the skimming and abstract reading stage, once the reading starts, however, I would absolutely recommend to add the read articles to the managment software: Keep the PDFs organized using the software, keep your annotations in there, keep your notes in there!\nAt the end of your literature search process, you should be able to write the related work section of your project report and methods section. The related work section is part of your introduction and should include a summary and analysis of the relevant studies and research that has been conducted on your topic. Furthermore, your method section should ideally contain references to previous studies that have used similar methods or approaches.\n\n\nPublish or Perish\nPublish or Perish is a neat piece of software, that helps documenting your literature review process. It provides a unified interface to a majority of databases. Each search can be saved, multiple searches can be organized into folders. Additionally, the results can be exported to different formats. Thus, Publish or Perish is also a good starting point for AI-Assisted literature reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnected Papers\nConnected Papers is one of my favorite tools for literature reseraches. Paste any DOI into the search field and the tool will create a graph of the article, linking the cited literature as well as incorporating newer literature that cites the work that you’ve been looking for. Using colors and node sizes all data is visualised neatly.\n\n\n\nGPT-Assisted Review\n\n\nAI Tools\nOver the past months, several AI Literature Review tools have been released:\n\nPerplexity incorporates GPT-3 (GPT-4 and Claude-2 in the pro version) and offers a chat interface. You can ask any question, it starts answering your question based on sources which are provided in the interface.\nElicit works somewhat differently, it expects you to ask a research question and tries to answer you question based on papers and has the ability to extract different type of information from papers automatically. In my experience the system does not work that well for social science questions.\nChatPDF is one of many tools that allow to upload PDF files, process them, and allow to chat with their content. In my experience it works rather well. However, as with all AI tools, we should be careful to manually verify the responses. The tool returns a link to the text anchor it refers to for answers. Overall, I recommend this tool for refinding information in papers that you’ve already read, or as a companion for skimming papers – although you might miss out important information!\nLangChain and LlamaIndex are python package that help building applications like ChatPDF yourself.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBainotti, Lucia, Alessandro Caliandro, and Alessandro Gandini. 2020. “From archive cultures to ephemeral content, and back: Studying Instagram Stories with digital methods.” New Media & Society, September, 1461444820960071. https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820960071.\n\n\nBast, Jennifer. 2021. “Politicians, Parties, and Government Representatives on Instagram: A Review of Research Approaches, Usage Patterns, and Effects.” Review of Communication Research 9 (July). https://www.rcommunicationr.org/index.php/rcr/article/view/108.\n\n\nHochman, Nadav, and Lev Manovich. 2013. “Zooming into an Instagram City: Reading the local through social media.” First Monday, June. https://doi.org/10.5210/fm.v18i7.4711.\n\n\nHu, Yuheng, Lydia Manikonda, and Subbarao Kambhampati. 2014. “What We Instagram: A First Analysis of Instagram Photo Content and User Types.” Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media 8 (1): 595–98. https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v8i1.14578.\n\n\nMilanesi, Matilde, and Simone Guercini. 2020. “Image-based Social Media and Visual Content Analysis: Insights from a Literature Review.” Micro & Macro Marketing, no. 3: 537–58. https://ideas.repec.org/a/mul/jyf1hn/doi10.1431-97640y2020i3p537-558.html.\n\n\nOmena, Janna Joceli, Pilipets Elena, Beatrice Gobbo, and Chao Jason. 2021. “The Potentials of Google Vision API-based Networks to Study Natively Digital Images.” Diseña, no. 19 (September): 1–1. https://doi.org/10.7764/disena.19.Article.1.\n\n\nOmena, Janna Joceli, Elaine Teixeira Rabello, and André Goes Mintz. 2020. “Digital Methods for Hashtag Engagement Research.” Social Media + Society 6 (3): 2056305120940697. https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305120940697.\n\n\nRejeb, Abderahman, Karim Rejeb, Alireza Abdollahi, and Horst Treiblmaier. 2022. “The big picture on Instagram research: Insights from a bibliometric analysis.” Telematics and Informatics 73 (September): 101876. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101876."
