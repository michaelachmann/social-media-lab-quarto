# Introduction
The research seminar [*Computational Analysis of Visual Social Media*](https://campusportal.uni-regensburg.de:443/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=46591&periodId=361) consists of project-centred work in groups, lectures on theory and practical sessions. Each group will follow their own research interests and datasets. Groups will be formed in the third session, together with preliminary topics. We have participants from different fields, the topics will mirror this interdisciplinarity, roughly drawn from the interesctions of media studies, political science, and communication science. The seminar aims at master students with first knowledge of at least one programming language. 

## What to Expect (Theoretical Skills)
By the end of the semester you should know more about:

* The state of Social Media Research,
* interesting questions to answer with social media data,
* ethical and legal restrictions,
* develop operationalizations for visual and textual data,


## What to Expect (Practical Skills)
By the end of the semester you will be able to: 

* Collect Instagram stories, posts and TikTok videos,
* apply OCR and automatically transcribe videos,
* computationally classify text and images using GPT and CLIP,
* evaluate and optimize your classifications using Human Annotations,
* present your results.


## Class Requirements
The following expectations and criteria must be met to pass the course:

* Independent immersion into a scientific topic: Literature research on your own topic, formulation of research questions, and operationalization.
* Familiarization with new tools (supported by practical units and some provided Jupyter Notebooks).
* Active and regular team collaboration on the individual project.
* Continuous documentation of current progress through a project wiki.
* Writing a project report at the end of the semester.


### Project Documentation
* I will provide a template for your report.
* You will continously add to your report at every stage.
* Through the semester we will come back to the draft.
* The goal is to publish the report on [social-media-lab.net](https://social-media-lab.net).

### Project Report
* The project report will be handed in collaboratively,
* consists of app. 20 pages,
* follows the *IMRAD*^[Introduction, Method, Result, Analaysis, Discussion] principle, 
* uses [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/) citation style,
* needs to be handed in no later than **31.03.2024**.

# Useful Tools

## Colab 

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) is a platform created by Google for collaborative work and research. It offers a preconfigured Python development environment with access to popular libraries and tools. It is based on [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Throughout the semester I am going to provide code for different applications as Jupyter notebooks, which can easily be accessed and run on Colab.

Colab can be used for free, but it also offers a paid subscription plan called Colab Pro. The pro version offers, among other features, access to GPUs, which are often used for machine learning. We are probably going to use APIs and GPT throughout the semester, if we need to access GPUs we may use [schlaubox](https://schlaubox.de/).
