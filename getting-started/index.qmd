# About the Course: Computational Analysis of Visual Social Media (Winter 2024/25)

This project-centered research seminar focuses on group work, lectures, and practical sessions. The seminar introduces students to various research methodologies, including data collection, content analysis, and machine learning techniques. Students will work with tools such as Whisper for video transcription, GPT, fine-tuning BERT variants, and multimodal models like GPT-4o. Groups will explore diverse research topics and datasets, such as political communication on social media, influencer content, and misinformation, guided by an interdisciplinary approach that integrates media studies, political science, and communication science. The seminar is designed for master students with basic programming experience.

Taught by [Michael Achmann-Denkler](https://go.ur.de/michael-achmann), a PhD candidate at the University of Regensburg, pursuing a PhD titled "Decoding Digital Campaigns: Computational Insights into Multimodal Political Communication on Social Media." This seminar is closely linked to his research, aiming to test approaches, methods, and ideas on a broader scale

### Course Outcomes

**Theoretical Skills**:
- Accessibility of social media data for researchers
- Concepts of text and images as data
- Ethical and legal limitations
- Understanding social media as trace data

**Practical Skills**:
- Collecting Instagram and TikTok content
- Applying OCR and video transcription
- Exploring and classifying text and images computationally
- Evaluating and optimizing classifications using human annotations
- Presenting research findings effectively

### Requirements
- Engage independently with literature, formulate research questions, and develop operationalizations
- Willingness to master new tools via practical exercises and provided Jupyter Notebooks
- Active and regular collaboration within your project team
- Continuous documentation of progress through a project wiki
- Submit a project report by the end of the semester

### Project Documentation
- Documentation will follow an Open Science approach
- Use the [project report template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCMQlDF85S5ua9dzhJ280gQzbbheo4zJvoVUwYAIdqg/edit?usp=sharing) for your final report
- Reports will be published on [social-media-lab.net](https://social-media-lab.net)

### Project Report
