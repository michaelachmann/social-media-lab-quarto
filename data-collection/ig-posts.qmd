Instagram offers two ways of image sharing: permanent posts and [ephemeral stories](ig-stories.qmd). In this chapter I will offer three approaches for collecting posts: [Instaloader](#instaloader), [CrowdTangle](#crowdtangle), and [Zeeschuimer](#zeeschuimer--4cat).

Posts offer different affordances. First of all they contain at least one image or video. Posts may also contain an album consisting of more than one image or video. Morever, posts are accompanied by a caption, a longer text snippet provided by the author of the post. These captions may contain hashtags and / or mentions. Hashtags are used to self-organize posts on the platform, users can subscribe to hashtags and search for them. Mentions are used to link a post to another profile. Moreover, users can like, share and comment posts. Some data-collection approaches, like CrowdTangle, offer access to one image and post metrics, like the comment and like count. Instaloader, offer access to all images / videos, while being the legally most questionable approach. And then there's the middle ground: Zeeschuimer (optionally in connection with 4CAT). 

Through the following subchapters I will try to illuminate the advantages of each collection methods. For each method I will provide a manual to follow in order to collect metadata and the actual media for Instagram posts.

## Instaloader
[Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/) is a python package for downloading instagram pictures and videos along with their metadata.
