Instagram offers two ways of image sharing: permanent posts and [ephemeral stories](ig-stories.qmd). In this chapter I will offer three approaches for collecting posts: [Instaloader](#instaloader), [CrowdTangle](#crowdtangle), and [Zeeschuimer](#zeeschuimer--4cat). 

<!--![ A screenshot of a post by @bundeskanzler.](/images/instagram-post.png){fig-align="center" width=95%} //-->

Posts are shaped by several [affordances](/getting-started/theory.qmd#platform-affordances) and contain different type of media: least one image or video, often paired with text (captions). Posts may also contain an album consisting of more than one image or video. Captions may contain hashtags and / or mentions. Hashtags are used to self-organize posts on the platform, users can subscribe to hashtags and search for them. Mentions are used to link a post to another profile. Moreover, users can like, share and comment posts. Some data-collection approaches, like CrowdTangle, offer access to one image and post metrics, like the comment and like count. Instaloader, offer access to all images / videos, while being the legally most questionable approach. And then there's the middle ground: Zeeschuimer (optionally in connection with 4CAT). 

Through the following subchapters I will try to illuminate the advantages of each collection methods. For each method I will provide a manual to follow in order to collect metadata and the actual media for Instagram posts.

## Instaloader
[Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/) is a python package for downloading instagram pictures and videos along with their metadata. I have written a [getting started tutorial on Medium](https://achmann.dev/getting-started-with-instagram-analysis-instaloader-bbf686cb6e3b). It is, together with [the provided notebook](https://github.com/michaelachmann/ig-tutorial/blob/main/01_DataCollection.ipynb), the basis for this chapter.

## CrowdTangle

[CrowdTangle](https://www.crowdtangle.com/) is the best option to collect IG posts -- in theory. It provides legal access to Instagram data and offers several tools to export large amount of data. For a current project we've exported more than 500.000 public posts through a hashtag query. Unfortunately there are several restrictions: CrowdTangle is the best tool to export metadata of public posts, and captions. The abilty to collect images through the platform is limited: Image links expire after a certain amount of time, thus we need to use some makeshift approach to download the images. When we can download the images, it's always just one per post, no matter if it's a gallery or a single image. And let's not talk about videos. I have written [another Medium story with a step-by-step guide to CrowdTangle](https://achmann.dev/crowdtangle-for-instagram-analysis-a-step-by-step-guide-for-beginners-6d4f1f8cb0a3).

## Zeeschuimer & 4CAT
Zeeschuimer [@Peeters_undated-ee] and 4CAT [@Peeters_undated-ow] are two tools developed for the [https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/](Digital Methods Initiative). The first is a firefox plugin that captures traffic when browsing websites likes Instagram or TikTok. The second, 4CAT, is an analysis platform incorporating several steps of preprocessing and further analyses. For post collection we can use the original [Zeeschuimer Firefox Plugin](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer), download the latest release from GitHub and install it in Firefox.

## Work-In-Progress
The tutorial will be released for our data collection session on November, 6th.
