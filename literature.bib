              networks, and presents two intellectual structure maps (i.e.,

               book-length examination of Instagram, Tama Leaver, Tim Highfield
               and Crystal Abidin trace how this quintessential mobile

               consider aspects such as the new visual social media aesthetics,
               the rise of Influencers and new visual economies, and the
               complex politics of the platform as well as examining how
               Instagram's users change their use of the platform over time and
               respond to evolving features. The book highlights the different
               ways Instagram is used by subcultural groups around the world,
               and how museums, restaurants and public spaces are striving to
               be 'Insta-worthy'. Far from just capturing milestones and

               Digital technology empowers us as never before, yet it has
               unforeseen consequences as well. Potentially humiliating content
               on Facebook is enshrined in cyberspace for future employers to

               and this has profound implications for us all.In Delete, Viktor
               Mayer-Sch{\"o}nberger traces the important role that forgetting
               has played throughout human history, from the ability to make
               sound decisions unencumbered by the past to the possibility of
               second chances. The written word made it possible for humans to
               remember across generations and time, yet now digital technology
               and global networks are overriding our natural ability to
               forget---the past is ever present, ready to be called up at the
               click of a mouse. Mayer-Sch{\"o}nberger examines the technology
               that's facilitating the end of forgetting---digitization, cheap
               storage and easy retrieval, global access, and increasingly
               powerful software---and describes the dangers of everlasting
               digital memory, whether it's outdated information taken out of
               context or compromising photos the Web won't let us forget. He
               explains why information privacy rights and other fixes can't

               party and candidate accounts on Instagram during the 2017 German
               federal election. Building upon previous research, we
               conceptualize how the digital architecture of the platform
               determines its communication norms and how the actual
               communication practices implemented by parties and candidates
               follow or violate these norms. Therefore, we analyze how
               Instagram is used to implement different campaign strategies,
               focusing on (1) the use of network-related Instagram
               features-like Hashtags-, (2) text-integrated images, (3)
               dominant visual themes, (4) visual personalization, and (5) the
               addressing of policy issues. Since Germany's voting system
               rewards both candidate- and party-focused campaigning, the
               country is an ideal case study for an appropriate comparison of
               party and candidate accounts. We conducted a quantitative
               content analysis of all 581 posts published on party and
               candidate accounts during the four weeks before the election.
               The results suggest that parties and candidates used
               complementary communication strategies instead of relying on a
               single tactic. We are able showing that parties in parts

               post professional personalized posts. The presented findings

               highlights, and opinions to product placements and endorsements,
               athletes are closer to fans and consumers than ever before.
               Social media also puts athletes in charge of the messages,
               images, and content regarding their careers and their lives.

               important time for women athletes to assess their own personal
               branding, as well as their professional and product branding.

               investigate how one particular social media advancement,
               Instagram Stories, has been incorporated by athletes into their

               permeating the background of ordinary life and standing

               obstruct the progress of computational text analysis methods

               development has prioritized technological over validity
               concerns, giving limited attention to the operationalization of
               social scientific measurements. Second, we identify a mismatch
               between CTAMs? focus on extracting specific contents and
               document-level patterns, and social science researchers? need
               for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text.
               Third, we argue that the dominance of English language tools
               depresses comparative research and inclusivity toward scholarly
               communities examining languages other than English. We
               substantiate our claims by drawing upon a broad review of
               methodological work in the computational social sciences, as
               well as an inventory of leading research publications using

              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data

              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a

               them. We illustrate the need for the interpretive process of
               viewing by simultaneously drawing on theories of visual
               semiotics, photography, and computer vision. Two illustrative
               applications of the distant viewing framework to our own
               research are draw upon to explicate the potential and breadth of
               the approach. A study of television series shows how facial
               detection is used to compare the role of actors within the
               narrative arcs across two competing series. An analysis of the
               Farm Security Administration--Office of War Information corpus
               of documentary photography is used to establish how photographic
               style compared and differed amongst those photographers involved
               with the collection. We then aim to show how our framework
               engages with current methodological and theoretical
               conversations occurring within the digital humanities.",

               allowed them to reposition their funeral experience amongst
               wider networks of acquaintances, friends, and family. We argue
               that photo-sharing through Instagram echoes broader shifts in
               commemorative and memorialization practices, moving away from
               formal and institutionalized rituals to informal and

               This research contributes to a broader understanding of how

               objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the
               evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new
               methodological outlook to examine such topics as the findings of
               inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate
               change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, and the
               censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers
               introduces a new vision and method for Internet research and at
               the same time applies them to the Web's objects of study, from
               tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media).",

              the content of the image itself, its specific `audiencing'

              different networks built upon computer vision features:
              image-label, image-web entities, and image-domain. Second, we
              present a research protocol diagram that illustrates how to build
              networks of images and respective descriptions or sites of

              data-relational (trans)formations and interpretative specifics.
              Three different case studies will be introduced as examples. In

               research by critically accounting for the relationship between
               hashtags and their forms of grammatization?the platform
               techno-materialization process of online activity. We approach
               hashtags as sociotechnical formations that serve social media
               research not only as criteria in corpus selection but also
               displaying the complexity of the online engagement and its
               entanglement with the technicity of web platforms. Therefore,
               the study of hashtag engagement requires a grasping of the
               functioning of the platform itself (technicity) along with the
               platform grammatization. In this respect, we propose the
               three-layered (3L) perspective for addressing hashtag
               engagement. The first contemplates potential differences between
               high-visibility and ordinary hashtag usage culture, its related
               actors, and content. The second focuses on hashtagging activity
               and the repurposing of how hashtags can be differently embedded
               into social media databases. The last layer looks particularly
               into the images and texts to which hashtags are brought to
               relation. To operationalize the 3L framework, we draw on the
               case of the ?impeachment-cum-coup? of Brazilian president Dilma
               Rousseff. When cross-read, the three layers add value to one

               and new roles played by consumers. An emerging trend affecting
               marketing research is the shift towards visuals among the main
               social media platforms. Image-based social media, such as
               Instagram, are rapidly growing not only among individual users
               but also among companies that use them as a powerful marketing
               tool. Thus, sharing images is becoming an integral part of the
               social media experience today, and the shift towards visuals is
               transforming the way people socialize, perceive the world, and
               construct a sense of self. The study of images is not new,
               although, with the emergence of new research contexts such as
               image-based social media, is taking on a new meaning and, for
               marketing researchers, this phenomenon raises conceptual,
               theoretical, and methodological challenges. The paper puts
               forward some reflections on the growing importance of visuals
               and image-based social media for online marketing research and
               focuses on the methodological approaches that allow marketing
               researchers to analyze visual data. In particular, the paper
               discusses visual content analysis, a methodological approach for
               the content analysis of visually-based data, and proposes a

               methodology for the study of image-based social media. The
