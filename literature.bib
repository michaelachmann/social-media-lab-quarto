               them attractive materials for designing natural language
               interactions. Using natural language to steer LLM outputs
               (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique
               potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective
               prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based
               interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts
               can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a
               design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting
               development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies.
               Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs
               opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways
               echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine
               learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human
               instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were
               barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have

                   text annotation, as their ease-of-use, high accuracy, and
                   relatively low costs have meant that their use has exploded
                   in recent months. However, the rapid growth of the field has
                   meant that LLM-based annotation has become something of an
                   academic Wild West: the lack of established practices and
                   standards has led to concerns about the quality and validity
                   of research. Researchers have warned that the ostensible
                   simplicity of LLMs can be misleading, as they are prone to
                   bias, misunderstandings, and unreliable results. Recognizing
                   the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper proposes a

               explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political
               ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social
               science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a
               road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we
               contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive
               evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13
               language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On
               taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to
               outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair
               levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks
               (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the
               quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the
               performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline
               in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human
               annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative
               generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTVisual content plays a crucial role in today?s online
               political communication, especially during election campaigns.
               Prior research on candidate imagery has shown particular effects
               from non-verbal behavior (e.g., smiling), contextual features
               (e.g., the depiction of other people), and structural
               characteristics (e.g., camera angle and proximity). Importantly,
               this study argues to look at candidate imagery as
               institutionalized means of political communication online. In
               the realm of the European Parliamentary Election 2019,
               self-promoted candidate imagery on social networking sites (SNS)
               is expected to align cross-nationally along party-family
               structures vis-{\`a}-vis respective imagery in the news, which
               is anticipated to align along national borders. We analyze and
               describe respective candidate imagery in both news and SNS from
               13,811 unique candidates across all 28 European member states by
               means of a computational content analysis of 79,500 images.
               After a manual two-step validation, which raises concerns about
               the validity of the computationally assigned camera angle,
               logistic regression models are used to estimate non-verbal
               behavior, contextual features, and structural characteristics.

  abstract  = "The hazards of perfect memory in the digital ageDelete looks at
               the surprising phenomenon of perfect remembering in the digital
               age, and reveals why we must reintroduce our capacity to forget.
               Digital technology empowers us as never before, yet it has
               unforeseen consequences as well. Potentially humiliating content
               on Facebook is enshrined in cyberspace for future employers to
               see. Google remembers everything we've searched for and when.
               The digital realm remembers what is sometimes better forgotten,
               and this has profound implications for us all.In Delete, Viktor
               Mayer-Sch{\"o}nberger traces the important role that forgetting
               has played throughout human history, from the ability to make
               sound decisions unencumbered by the past to the possibility of
               second chances. The written word made it possible for humans to
               remember across generations and time, yet now digital technology
               and global networks are overriding our natural ability to
               forget---the past is ever present, ready to be called up at the
               click of a mouse. Mayer-Sch{\"o}nberger examines the technology
               that's facilitating the end of forgetting---digitization, cheap
               storage and easy retrieval, global access, and increasingly
               powerful software---and describes the dangers of everlasting
               digital memory, whether it's outdated information taken out of
               context or compromising photos the Web won't let us forget. He
               explains why information privacy rights and other fixes can't
               help us, and proposes an ingeniously simple
               solution---expiration dates on information---that may.Delete is
               an eye-opening book that will help us remember how to forget in

              resolve annotator disagreements and derive single ground truth
              labels from multiple annotations. However, annotators may
              systematically disagree with one another, often reflecting their
              individual biases and values, especially in the case of
              subjective tasks such as detecting affect, aggression, and hate
              speech. Annotator disagreements may capture important nuances in
              such tasks that are often ignored while aggregating annotations
              to a single ground truth. In order to address this, we
              investigate the efficacy of multi-annotator models. In
              particular, our multi-task based approach treats predicting each
              annotators' judgements as separate subtasks, while sharing a
              common learned representation of the task. We show that this
              approach yields same or better performance than aggregating
              labels in the data prior to training across seven different
              binary classification tasks. Our approach also provides a way to
              estimate uncertainty in predictions, which we demonstrate better
              correlate with annotation disagreements than traditional methods.
              Being able to model uncertainty is especially useful in
              deployment scenarios where knowing when not to make a prediction

               crucial to incorporate the increasingly prevalent visual media

               theoretical opportunities of automated visual analysis for the
               study of social media effects and present an overview of
               existing computational methods that can facilitate this.

               existing computer vision tools and the theoretical concepts
               relevant to media effects research. We propose multiple

               applying unsupervised learning to discover meaningful visual
               themes and categories. We conclude with a discussion about

               communication scholars and practitioners. Images matter because
               they help individuals evaluate policies, primarily through
               emotional resonance, and can help researchers from a variety of
               ﬁelds measure otherwise diﬃcult to estimate quantities. The lack
               of scalable analytic methods, however, has prevented researchers
               from incorporating large scale image data in studies. This
               article oﬀers an in-depth overview of automated methods for
               image analysis and explains their usage and implementation. It
               elaborates on how these methods and results can be validated and
               interpreted and discusses ethical concerns. Two examples then
               highlight approaches to systematically understanding visual
               presentations of political actors and events from large scale
               image datasets collected from social media. The ﬁrst study
               examines gender and party diﬀerences in the self-presentation of
               the U.S. politicians through their Facebook photographs, using
               an oﬀ-the-shelf computer vision model, Google's Label Detection
               API. The second study develops image classiﬁers based on
               convolutional neural networks to detect custom labels from
               images of protesters shared on Twitter to understand how
               protests are framed on social media. These analyses demonstrate
               advantages of computer vision and deep learning as a novel
               analytic tool that can expand the scope and size of traditional
               visual analysis to thousands of features and millions of images.

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThis article compares the communication strategies of
               party and candidate accounts on Instagram during the 2017 German
               federal election. Building upon previous research, we
               conceptualize how the digital architecture of the platform
               determines its communication norms and how the actual
               communication practices implemented by parties and candidates
               follow or violate these norms. Therefore, we analyze how
               Instagram is used to implement different campaign strategies,
               focusing on (1) the use of network-related Instagram
               features-like Hashtags-, (2) text-integrated images, (3)
               dominant visual themes, (4) visual personalization, and (5) the
               addressing of policy issues. Since Germany's voting system
               rewards both candidate- and party-focused campaigning, the
               country is an ideal case study for an appropriate comparison of
               party and candidate accounts. We conducted a quantitative
               content analysis of all 581 posts published on party and
               candidate accounts during the four weeks before the election.
               The results suggest that parties and candidates used
               complementary communication strategies instead of relying on a
               single tactic. We are able showing that parties in parts
               strategically violated Instagram's communication norms to convey
               hard-to-visualize policy messages while candidates prefered to
               post professional personalized posts. The presented findings
               provide a starting point for future studies on the perceptions
               and behavioral outcomes of different campaign strategies.",

               news coverage of elections and to connect these visual images
               with shifts in public opinion. Presenting the results of a
               comprehensive visual analysis of general election news from
               1992-2004, encompassing four presidential campaigns, the authors
               highlight the remarkably potent influence of television images
               when it comes to evaluating leaders. The book draws from a
               variety of disciplines, including political science, behavioral
               biology, cognitive neuroscience, and media studies, to
               investigate the visual framing of elections in an incisive,

               presents findings that are counterintuitive and challenge widely
               held assumptions--yet are supported by systematic data. For
               example, Republicans receive consistently more favorable visual
               treatment than Democrats, countering the conventional wisdom of
               a ``liberal media bias''; and image bites are more prevalent,
               and in some elections more potent, in shaping voter opinions of
               candidates than sound bites. Finally, the authors provide a
               foundation for promoting visual literacy among news audiences

              which Instagram allows political candidates to build their
              digital image; that is, to perform online self-representation.
              Specifically, the focus of this paper is the image of political
              candidates on Instagram during the campaign of the 2021 Catalan
              regional elections on February 14. It links Goffman's (1956)
              theory of the presentation of the self in everyday life to both
              current research approaches to online self-representation and
              Grabe and Bucy's (2009) visual framing theory. The objective is
              to study the type of elements employed by candidates for
              constructing their photographic and video stage settings and,
              therefore, their digital identities during the election campaign.
              After an operationalization of Goffman's and Grabe and Bucy's
              theories resulting in 27 items, a content analysis was carried
              out on a total of 215 Instagram posts of the eight main
              candidates published between 29 January and 13 February 2021. It
              has been observed that all political candidates show themselves
              in a more professional way, and it couldn't be affirmed that a
              certain visual frame is attached to a certain ideology. In line
              with previous research, our results show that the `ideal
              candidate' was the predominating frame, although particularities

                   with synthetic data via simple prompts, in three different
                   classification tasks with varying complexity. For each task,
                   we randomly select a base sample of 500 texts to generate
                   5,000 new synthetic samples. We explore two augmentation
                   strategies: one that preserves original label distribution
                   and another that balances the distribution. Using a
                   progressively larger training sample size, we train and
                   evaluate a 110M parameter multilingual language model on the

                   application of large pre-trained models in real-world tasks.
                   In past years, Prompt engineering has been well-studied in
                   natural language processing. Recently, it has also been

                   Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize

                   range of problems so that they can be adapted to different

                   been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM
                   conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate
                   samples of news articles which human evaluators have
                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

               language prompt that contains a few training examples. We show
               that this type of few-shot learning can be unstable: the choice
               of prompt format, training examples, and even the order of the
               examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to near
               state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises
               from the bias of language models towards predicting certain
               answers, e.g., those that are placed near the end of the prompt
               or are common in the pre-training data. To mitigate this, we
               first estimate the model's bias towards each answer by asking
               for its prediction when given a training prompt and a
               content-free test input such as ``N/A''. We then fit calibration
               parameters that cause the prediction for this input to be
               uniform across answers. On a diverse set of tasks, this
               contextual calibration procedure substantially improves GPT-3

  abstract  = "This article surveys and organizes research works in a new
               paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub
               ``prompt-based learning.'' Unlike traditional supervised
               learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict
               an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on
               language models that model the probability of text directly. To
               use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input
               x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x′
               that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is
               used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to
               obtain a final string x̂, from which the final output y can be
               derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number
               of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on
               massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting
               function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot
               learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data.
               In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising
               paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that
               can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing
               work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained
               language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the
               field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make
               a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured
               typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other
               resources, e.g., a website including constantly updated survey

                   tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of
                   text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While
                   typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still
                   requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or
                   tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can
                   generally perform a new language task from only a few
                   examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we
                   show that scaling up language models greatly improves
                   task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching
                   competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive
                   language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than
                   any previous non-sparse language model, and test its
                   performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
                   tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text
                   interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong
                   performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several
                   tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain
                   adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
                   in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same
                   time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot
                   learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where
                   GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on
                   large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate
                   samples of news articles which human evaluators have
                   difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.
                   We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of

               to construct and promote the image of a charismatic leader. To
               do so, we conduct a topic modelling of 6854 Instagram posts made
               by Ramzan Kadyrov, the dictatorial head of the autonomous
               Chechen Republic in the Russian Federation. We then analyze the
               verbal framing of 24 dominant topics. The study concludes that
               the main rhetorical device that Kadyrov employs is a merging of
               personal and political themes throughout his posts. He
               personalizes political discussion by discussing public interest
               topics through the prism of his own personal life, and inserts
               political discourse into personal, intimate posts about his
               family, pastimes, and friends. The study shows that this tactic,
               often understood by media researchers as an oppositional device
               for harnessing popular support against an autocratic state, can
               be just as successfully employed by an autocratic leader.
               Kadyrov, who in his Instagram combines the tactics of a populist
               politician and an internet celebrity, has shaped a personality
               that can be best described as a ``flirting populist'' (Vezjak,

               development has prioritized technological over validity
               concerns, giving limited attention to the operationalization of
               social scientific measurements. Second, we identify a mismatch

               document-level patterns, and social science researchers? need
               for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text.
               Third, we argue that the dominance of English language tools
               depresses comparative research and inclusivity toward scholarly
               communities examining languages other than English. We
               substantiate our claims by drawing upon a broad review of

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTInstagram is one of the most popular social media
               platforms worldwide, making it a key site for social
               examination. Despite this, scholarly conversations about
               analysing Instagram data remain scarce, with existing research
               focusing on text-driven platforms such as Twitter.This year,
               Instagram permanently disabled access to its Legacy API. For
               users, this has been hailed as positive, increasing privacy and
               control. However, these actions have unintentional impacts on
               research, creating significant access barriers. How researchers
               continue to engage with Instagram data as ?personal data? is a
               central question, particularly in light of global privacy events
               like Cambridge Analytica.This article contributes to emerging
               discussions about approaching visual social media, responding to
               ethical and policy challenges of Instagram data. It details the
               process of accessing, archiving and anonymising Instagram data
               from a three-year platform study. Social research now encounters
               multiple commercial gatekeepers, where third-party applications
               are pivotal, and paywalls widen access inequalities.",

               theoretical framework for the study of large collections of
               visual materials. Our framework, distant viewing, is
               distinguished from other approaches by making explicit the
               interpretive nature of extracting semantic metadata from images.
               In other words, one must `view' visual materials before studying
               them. We illustrate the need for the interpretive process of
               viewing by simultaneously drawing on theories of visual
               semiotics, photography, and computer vision. Two illustrative
               applications of the distant viewing framework to our own
               research are draw upon to explicate the potential and breadth of
               the approach. A study of television series shows how facial
               detection is used to compare the role of actors within the
               narrative arcs across two competing series. An analysis of the
               Farm Security Administration--Office of War Information corpus
               of documentary photography is used to establish how photographic
               style compared and differed amongst those photographers involved
               with the collection. We then aim to show how our framework

               Annotations never capture a whole image. The way digital images

               record designed for probing the digital-textual world as it

               images uploaded with the hashtag \#funeral often communicated a

               allowed them to reposition their funeral experience amongst
               wider networks of acquaintances, friends, and family. We argue
               that photo-sharing through Instagram echoes broader shifts in
               commemorative and memorialization practices, moving away from
               formal and institutionalized rituals to informal and

               theoretical framework for the study of large collections of
               visual materials. Our framework, distant viewing, is
               distinguished from other approaches by making explicit the
               interpretive nature of extracting semantic metadata from images.
               In other words, one must `view' visual materials before studying
               them. We illustrate the need for the interpretive process of
               viewing by simultaneously drawing on theories of visual
               semiotics, photography, and computer vision. Two illustrative
               applications of the distant viewing framework to our own
               research are draw upon to explicate the potential and breadth of
               the approach. A study of television series shows how facial
               detection is used to compare the role of actors within the
               narrative arcs across two competing series. An analysis of the
               Farm Security Administration--Office of War Information corpus
               of documentary photography is used to establish how photographic
               style compared and differed amongst those photographers involved
               with the collection. We then aim to show how our framework
               engages with current methodological and theoretical

               Rogers proposes a methodological outlook for social and cultural
               scholarly research on the Web that seeks to move Internet
               research beyond the study of online culture. It is not a toolkit
               for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software
               package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study
               social media to learn something about society rather than about
               social media use? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native
               techniques for research into cultural change and societal
               conditions. We can learn to reapply such ``methods of the
               medium'' as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar
               algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn
               how they handle hits, likes, tags, date stamps, and other
               Web-native objects. By ``thinking along'' with devices and the
               objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the
               evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new
               methodological outlook to examine such topics as the findings of
               inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate
               change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, and the
               censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers
               introduces a new vision and method for Internet research and at
               the same time applies them to the Web's objects of study, from
               tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media).",

               hashtags as sociotechnical formations that serve social media
               research not only as criteria in corpus selection but also
               displaying the complexity of the online engagement and its

               platform grammatization. In this respect, we propose the
               three-layered (3L) perspective for addressing hashtag
               engagement. The first contemplates potential differences between
               high-visibility and ordinary hashtag usage culture, its related

               case of the ?impeachment-cum-coup? of Brazilian president Dilma
               Rousseff. When cross-read, the three layers add value to one

               and new roles played by consumers. An emerging trend affecting
               marketing research is the shift towards visuals among the main
               social media platforms. Image-based social media, such as
               Instagram, are rapidly growing not only among individual users
               but also among companies that use them as a powerful marketing
               tool. Thus, sharing images is becoming an integral part of the
               social media experience today, and the shift towards visuals is
               transforming the way people socialize, perceive the world, and
               construct a sense of self. The study of images is not new,
               although, with the emergence of new research contexts such as
               image-based social media, is taking on a new meaning and, for
