              fill this knowledge gap, this study carries out a holistic
              bibliometric and network analysis of Instagram research,
              illustrating the dynamic evolution from 2013 to 2021. On the
              basis of 2,242 publications from the Web of Science database,
              which were authored by 6,206 researchers, this study identifies
              the most prominent scholars and articles in the literature.
              Furthermore, it analyzes diverse bibliometric networks, such as
              citation, co-citation, collaboration and keyword co-occurrence
              networks, and presents two intellectual structure maps (i.e.,
              conceptual structure map, thematic map). The results indicate
              that the number of academic studies about Instagram has been
              growing significantly over time and that the dominant topics are
              the psychological motivation of Instagram use, the COVID-19

              who uses Instagram, how do they use it, and with what effect?

              drawing on a weeklong data set of nearly 32 million tweets,

               allowed them to reposition their funeral experience amongst
               wider networks of acquaintances, friends, and family. We argue
               that photo-sharing through Instagram echoes broader shifts in
               commemorative and memorialization practices, moving away from

               In other words, one must `view' visual materials before studying
               them. We illustrate the need for the interpretive process of
               viewing by simultaneously drawing on theories of visual
               semiotics, photography, and computer vision. Two illustrative

               Rogers proposes a methodological outlook for social and cultural
               scholarly research on the Web that seeks to move Internet
               research beyond the study of online culture. It is not a toolkit
               for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software
               package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study
               social media to learn something about society rather than about
               social media use? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native
               techniques for research into cultural change and societal
               conditions. We can learn to reapply such ``methods of the
               medium'' as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar
               algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn
               how they handle hits, likes, tags, date stamps, and other
               Web-native objects. By ``thinking along'' with devices and the
               objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the
               evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new
               methodological outlook to examine such topics as the findings of
               inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate
               change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, and the
               censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers
               introduces a new vision and method for Internet research and at
               the same time applies them to the Web's objects of study, from
               tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media).",

              API-based networks for studying online images, covering three
              important modalities as part of a critical visual methodology:
              the content of the image itself, its specific `audiencing'
              through web references (or image metadata), and the sites of
              image circulation. First, we conceptually and technically define
              different networks built upon computer vision features:
              image-label, image-web entities, and image-domain. Second, we
              present a research protocol diagram that illustrates how to build
              networks of images and respective descriptions or sites of
              circulation. Third, we discuss the potentialities of computer
              vision networks as a research device, stressing their
              data-relational (trans)formations and interpretative specifics.
              Three different case studies will be introduced as examples. In
              conclusion, we argue that such a visual methodology requires
              critical technical practices accounting for the multiple layers
              of technical mediation involved.",

               research by critically accounting for the relationship between
               hashtags and their forms of grammatization?the platform
               techno-materialization process of online activity. We approach
               hashtags as sociotechnical formations that serve social media
               research not only as criteria in corpus selection but also
               displaying the complexity of the online engagement and its
               entanglement with the technicity of web platforms. Therefore,
               the study of hashtag engagement requires a grasping of the
               functioning of the platform itself (technicity) along with the
               platform grammatization. In this respect, we propose the
               three-layered (3L) perspective for addressing hashtag
               engagement. The first contemplates potential differences between
               high-visibility and ordinary hashtag usage culture, its related
               actors, and content. The second focuses on hashtagging activity
               and the repurposing of how hashtags can be differently embedded
               into social media databases. The last layer looks particularly
               into the images and texts to which hashtags are brought to
               relation. To operationalize the 3L framework, we draw on the
               case of the ?impeachment-cum-coup? of Brazilian president Dilma
               Rousseff. When cross-read, the three layers add value to one
               another, providing also difference visions of the
               high-visibility and ordinary groups.",

               factors, such as new technologies, new online market contexts,
               and new roles played by consumers. An emerging trend affecting
               marketing research is the shift towards visuals among the main
               social media platforms. Image-based social media, such as
               Instagram, are rapidly growing not only among individual users
               but also among companies that use them as a powerful marketing
               tool. Thus, sharing images is becoming an integral part of the
               social media experience today, and the shift towards visuals is
               transforming the way people socialize, perceive the world, and
               construct a sense of self. The study of images is not new,
               although, with the emergence of new research contexts such as
               image-based social media, is taking on a new meaning and, for
               marketing researchers, this phenomenon raises conceptual,
               theoretical, and methodological challenges. The paper puts
               forward some reflections on the growing importance of visuals
               and image-based social media for online marketing research and
               focuses on the methodological approaches that allow marketing
               researchers to analyze visual data. In particular, the paper
               discusses visual content analysis, a methodological approach for
               the content analysis of visually-based data, and proposes a
               systematic review of recent researches that adopt such
               methodology for the study of image-based social media. The

               bypass the Instagram API closure and (b) engages in an attempt

               tension between ephemeral content and archive cultures, and

  abstract = "Instagram is a relatively new form of communication where users
              can easily share their updates by taking photos and tweaking them
              using filters. It has seen rapid growth in the number of users as
              well as uploads since it was launched in October 2010. In spite
              of the fact that it is the most popular photo capturing and
              sharing application, it has attracted relatively less attention

              about Instagram which were never studied before, that include: 1)
              Eight popular photos categories, 2) Five distinct types of
              Instagram users in terms of their posted photos, and 3) A user's
              audience (number of followers) is independent of his/her shared
