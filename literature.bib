              bibliometric techniques to comprehensively portray the field. To
              fill this knowledge gap, this study carries out a holistic
              bibliometric and network analysis of Instagram research,
              illustrating the dynamic evolution from 2013 to 2021. On the
              basis of 2,242 publications from the Web of Science database,
              which were authored by 6,206 researchers, this study identifies
              the most prominent scholars and articles in the literature.
              Furthermore, it analyzes diverse bibliometric networks, such as
              citation, co-citation, collaboration and keyword co-occurrence
              networks, and presents two intellectual structure maps (i.e.,
              conceptual structure map, thematic map). The results indicate
              that the number of academic studies about Instagram has been
              growing significantly over time and that the dominant topics are
              the psychological motivation of Instagram use, the COVID-19
              pandemic, Instagram marketing, social media platforms, and
              healthcare.",

              focus on images, which can be accompanied by lengthy captions as

              Therefore, it is no surprise that Instagram has attracted the
              interest of scholars of various research areas. This article
              provides a systematic review of 37 studies on Instagram usage by
              politicians, parties, and governments. The aim is to gather
              substantiated knowledge while identifying research gaps. To this
              end, the review focuses on three key areas of Instagram research:
              who uses Instagram, how do they use it, and with what effect?
              Methodological approaches, data basis, and applied theories are
              included to provide a comprehensive overview of research on
              Instagram. Based on the findings, points of departure for future

              Three different case studies will be introduced as examples. In

               hashtags and their forms of grammatization?the platform
               techno-materialization process of online activity. We approach
               hashtags as sociotechnical formations that serve social media
               research not only as criteria in corpus selection but also
               displaying the complexity of the online engagement and its
               entanglement with the technicity of web platforms. Therefore,
               the study of hashtag engagement requires a grasping of the
               functioning of the platform itself (technicity) along with the
               platform grammatization. In this respect, we propose the
               three-layered (3L) perspective for addressing hashtag
               engagement. The first contemplates potential differences between
               high-visibility and ordinary hashtag usage culture, its related
               actors, and content. The second focuses on hashtagging activity
               and the repurposing of how hashtags can be differently embedded
               into social media databases. The last layer looks particularly
               into the images and texts to which hashtags are brought to
               relation. To operationalize the 3L framework, we draw on the
               case of the ?impeachment-cum-coup? of Brazilian president Dilma
               Rousseff. When cross-read, the three layers add value to one

               marketing research is the shift towards visuals among the main
               social media platforms. Image-based social media, such as
               Instagram, are rapidly growing not only among individual users
               but also among companies that use them as a powerful marketing
               tool. Thus, sharing images is becoming an integral part of the
               social media experience today, and the shift towards visuals is
               transforming the way people socialize, perceive the world, and
               construct a sense of self. The study of images is not new,
               although, with the emergence of new research contexts such as
               image-based social media, is taking on a new meaning and, for
               marketing researchers, this phenomenon raises conceptual,
               theoretical, and methodological challenges. The paper puts

               the content analysis of visually-based data, and proposes a
